Based on the data from the F5 Labs article, here's a concise and informative list: 
1. Emergence of new malware written in Go (Golang), targeting Linux-based servers for Monero cryptocurrency mining.
2. Spreads using seven methods including exploiting four web application vulnerabilities (ThinkPHP, Drupal, Confluence), SSH credential enumeration, Redis password enumeration, and leveraging found SSH keys.
3. Primary goal is to install a cryptominer targeting Monero.
4. On compromising a system, executes a bash script from Pastebin to download, decode, and run further payloads.
5. Establishes persistence through cron jobs, disables security controls, and sets itself as a service on the infected machine.
6.Kills other processes especially those consuming significant CPU resources, likely other cryptominers.
7. Attempts to infect known SSH hosts from the infected machine.
8. Not widely detected by antivirus programs at the time of the article, often classified as a generic threat.

Solutions:
1. Disconnect the affected systems from your network to prevent the malware from spreading.
2. Change all passwords and review user access privileges. Ensure that credentials are strong and SSH keys are secure
3 Implement or enhance system and network monitoring to detect and alert on unusual activities
4.Integrate security practices into your CI/CD pipeline.
5. Develop or update your incident response plan for handling such security breaches in the future.
6. Check your codebase and third-party dependencies for potential vulnerabilities or malicious code.
7. Update all software, including your Go environment and dependencies, to the latest versions. Apply all relevant security patches.
8.Use code quality tools on before and after development to detect lack code like sonarlint, sonarqube
